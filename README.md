- [Hardware design with RP2040](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/rp2040/hardware-design-with-rp2040.pdf) - Explains the RP2040 arm processor schematics and how to build additional hardware that incorporates this processor, 32 pages
- [Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf) - Manual for installing Pico development toolchain on Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows, and how to setup the C SDK or MicroPython development environments, 77 pages
- [C/C++ development](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-c-sdk.pdf) - In depth explanation of the C/C++ SDK, its architecture, the full library, examples and a guide to the PIO state machines, 281 pages
- [MicroPython development](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-python-sdk.pdf) - Introduction to the MicroPython development environment, explains how to use the interactive interpreter, lists library functions, and shows the Thonny IDE, 47 pages
- [Get Started with Micro Python Development](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/books/micropython-pico) - Handbook with step-by-step example to assemble and program Pico projects like a traffic light LED controller, temperature sensors, movements sensors and more, available as paid printed, or paid/free e-book, 139 pages

## Tools

- [RP2040 PIO Simulator](https://github.com/soundpaint/rp2040pio) - Still in development, but promising PIO simulator. You upload a PIO program, and then can step-through the instructions. UI windows show which GPIO pins are active, or you can get a time-sequence of all pins.
- [rp2040](https://github.com/pyTony/rp2040) - Early Development Prototype, no release yet.
- [Pico Emu](https://github.com/Supercip971/pico-emu) - Early Development Prototype, no release yet.
- [rp2040js](https://github.com/wokwi/rp2040js) - Pico simulator in JavaScript, in active development, you can even see live coding video from the [project page](https://hackaday.io/project/177082-raspberry-pi-pico-emulator).
